The sun may set, but it will rise,
Bringing light to darkened skies.
Dreams may falter, hopes may wane,
Yet strength within will rise again.

Storms may come and winds may blow,
But roots run deep where courage grows.
Each new dawn a chance to be,
A step toward your destiny.

So lift your head, embrace the fight,
For even stars are born from night.
Shine your light, let worries fade,
You are strong, you are brave.
